## Hello, my name is Marcelo and I'm a beginner GameDev!

- 👀 Training to become a good programmer and a GameDev;
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about engines and learning how to create worlds and stories;
- 💞️ I want to help everyone evolve and be able to achieve the best version of themselves as I evolve;
- 📫 How to reach me marceloecariny@gmail.com;
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him;
- ⚡ a funny fact: you'll probably laugh a lot seeing me freak out for having solved a problem in the code (it was just a ";" hahahaha);
